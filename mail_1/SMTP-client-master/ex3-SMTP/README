SMTP
1.) introduction:
SMTP is a protocol which through it messages are sent from the sender mail server to the reipient mail server.


This program is an implementation of a SMTP client side .
With this program you can send email from one email to another.


Structure of an SMTP email comunication:
sender -->User Agent --->mail server of the sender---->SMTP----->mail server of the riecipnt--->User Agent --->sender.


How SMTP works:
1.The client side of the SMTP(which is the sender) gets the IP address and the host name of the server side of the SMTP(which is the mail server).
2.The client opens a TCP socket connection and connects with port 25 to the server(the mail server deals with the accpet(),listen() and all of the socket server side functions ).
3.The server and the client makes a "handshake": they introdoce themself to each other.
4.The client sends the email via the socket to the server by using SMTP commands(HELO,MAIL FROM ,RCPT TO,DATA,QUIT).
5.The server responds to each message of the client indicating if there was a error or not.
6.The email is sent.


2.)Program output:
the program output is in this form:
c:messge
s:respond
c:messgae
s:respond
...
where c: is the clinet sending message to the server via the socket
and     s: is the server responds to the client message.

3.)How to run the program: 
-open the Terminal.
-compile the project by entering "make".
-enter ./smtp   file.txt    mail_server   port_number.


4.)Submitted files:
Makefile-the file that take care of the compilation. The input file is named smtp.exe.
main.c-source file containts the main function and all the functions for the program.
